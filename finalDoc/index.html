    <h4>Purpose and final features</h4>
    <p>The final purpose of our app is to draw on a canvas with multiple people across a server. The features of the app are drawing on a single canvas across a joined room, the UI includes synced items as well, such as line width,
    line color. Other UI features include a client side clear button (was supposed to be synced across everyone but we had trouble) that clears the clients canvas. A save picture button that will export what is on the canvas into a 
	new window where the user can right-click and perform a save as on the picture, to save for themselves. We also have a chat room to the left of the canvas that when a user connects the drawing room they connect to the chat room corresponding to the room they picked. Users in the same room can talk to each other via the chat room. Before you can get into the app, a user has to sign in to the program to use it. If a user doesn't have an account they can visit the sign up page to make an account. </p>
    <h4>What we did well/didn't do well.</h4>
	<p>The things we did well were the drawing across the server to the clients. It works relatively well with a couple bugs. The syncing of the UI is pretty well done too. The login/signup system works to the way we wanted. Things we would've improved upon was the act of drawing itself. We have lag issues with the brush where it lags the page it seems. 
	Once you joined a room for the first time it doesn't log you out of that room once you join another.</p>

    <h4>What interested us most</h4>
    <p>We had an interesting time figuring out multiple things with this project. The syncing of the data points across the server so that all people in the room saw the same drawing. Along side that syncing the UI options across the server was a real fun time also.</p>
